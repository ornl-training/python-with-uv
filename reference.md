## Glossary

Definitions for various terms used in this workshop are provided below.

dependency
: A dependency in a Python project is an external Python package that must be added to the Python environment. Use the `uv add` command or manually add the dependency to the `pyproject.toml` file to include in the Python environment. A dependency can also be defined in a Python script using the "script" declaration in the file.

package
: A Python package is a way of organizing and structuring Python code by grouping related modules (Python files) into directories which are typically located in a `src` directory. This allows developers to efficiently manage larger codebases, avoid naming conflicts, and reuse code across multiple projects.

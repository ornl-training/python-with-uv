## Installing uv

The only requirement for this workshop is the uv tool. Detailed installation instructions are given in the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) but the main macOS, Linux, and Windows installation commands are presented below.

Install uv on macOS and Linux with:

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Install uv on Windows with:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

That's it! You are now ready to run Python code. With uv you do not need to worry about installing Python or activating virtual environments, uv handles all of this for you.
